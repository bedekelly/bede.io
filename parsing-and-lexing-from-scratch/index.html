            <p>After reading Ready Player One, I'm hyped up for open-world interactive gaming. I don't give a monkey's about the interface; to me, the permissive nature of the game's world is the important thing. I want it to be as easy as possible to expand: patch in new items, vehicles, quests, you name it.</p>

<p>My idea, eventually, is to write something like an interactive text fiction game: check out <a href="http://www.web-adventures.org/cgi-bin/webfrotz?s=Zork1&amp;t=Y">Zork</a> if you haven't seen this kind of thing before, it's way cool. </p>

<p>So, what better place to start than...</p>

<h3 id="languagechoice">Language Choice</h3>

<p>One of the first things I decided upon straight away when thinking about this project was that I want to build as much as possible from scratch. Especially since the interface is going to be so comparatively easy to write, I want  something that's going to be a real project to get my teeth into. That means writing parsers and lexers from scratch, and quite possibly writing my own console-like interface with a terminal control library to get it <em>just right</em>. And, as regards language choice, it means I won't be using anything like dedicated interactive fiction languages. I'm sure they work very well at what they do, but it'll be a much more rewarding and - hopefully - fun exercise to write the implementation code myself.</p>

<p>I briefly considered C for this project, as I'm currently learning it at a basic level (and NCurses is a native C library). But thinking about implementing a parser in C makes me cringe - I'd much rather have the abstraction of Python when it comes to operations like stripping the spaces out of strings.</p>

<p>Python seems like as good a choice as any. It's got a decent regular expression library (at least, for our purposes), lots of built-in string methods like <code>str.strip</code>, and a very easy-to-navigate system of objects and namespaces. As well as this, it's got a well-documented module of bindings for libncurses, and I've got some boilerplate code sitting around already for relatively pain-free terminal control (context-manager decorators for setting up a stdscr with curses etc.). </p>

<p>Python also has the advantage of its interactive prompt (i.e. a read-eval-print-loop). This will undoubtedly be invaluable when it comes to testing code on-the-fly: I can't even imagine recompiling every time I want to test some code in, say, C++.</p>

<h3 id="interface">Interface</h3>

<p>The interface is absolutely not the focus of the project, so I won't spend any more time than necessary on getting a working prototype; I can always polish it up (add colours, etc.) after the language processing is in a working state. It will have two main components:</p>

<ul>
<li>The input box - a standard editable text box for the user's input; and</li>
<li>The output box - a scrolling display for the displayed output.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

<p>I'm hoping to use some kind of client-server model for this game. It's not going to be multiplayer - at least, not in the forseeable future - but it should have some kind of time simulation. This will probably be implemented using threads. The server and client will have two message pipes between them - the server will read/lex/parse/execute the client's messages, and send back messages which the client prints. The server may also be running other threads, which have access to the out-pipe but not the in-pipe, and therefore can send messages to the client (e.g. hunger warnings, environment events). It'll almost definitely have some kind of system for 'ticks', or arbitrary small units of time. The server will hold all of the information about the player in state, and the goal will be to achieve "separation of concerns" (ew) such that multiple save slots will be available, indexed by player name.</p>
