<p>To better understand the current problems facing those downloading multiple repositories from a user's Github account, I will observe a frequent user of Git and Github clone multiple repositories from a remote user. Our remote user, <a href="https://github.com/simon-weber?tab=repositories">simon-weber</a> has at the time of writing exactly 40 repositories. Our test user has been instructed to download the 'muspy', 'gomegle', 'crunchbang-conf' and 'omegle-to-irc' repositories.</p>

<p>Below is a screenshot showing the test user's attempts to clone these repositories. Note the spelling mistake made in cloning 'crunchbang-conf', leading to an error that the test user must use a keyboard interrupt to escape from, and the amount of characters necessary to type out these commands.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../content/images/2015/01/git_woes.png" alt="Screenshot showing a long, failed trail of Git commands, ending in Control-C to exit the program" /></p>

<p>This observation highlighted some key flaws in the way that multiple Github repositories must be cloned:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Every repository requires its own command to clone. Our test user circumvented this by using the Bash syntax to instruct the shell to run multiple commands sequentially, but this means extremely long lines of code. *</p></li>
<li><p>Every repository's URL must be found and copied into the terminal, whether by hand or by using system functions (e.g. middle-click on Unix systems). While the copying may not be overly time-consuming for a small number of repositories, for a larger number it will get increasingly frustrating for the user (in fact, the user did report a sense of annoyance at having to perform such a menial action just 4 times).</p></li>
<li><p>The output is completely opaque to any non-expert user. The version control system Git is renowned for being difficult to use: see <a href="http://merrigrove.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/why-heck-is-git-so-hard-places-model-ok.html">here</a> and <a href="http://stevebennett.me/2012/02/24/10-things-i-hate-about-git/">here</a> (warning: strong language) for examples of user frustration and confusion.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My project, then, should aim to provide a clear, simple method of cloning single or multiple repositories from a single Github user's account.</p>

<p>In order to gain a more clear idea of the required solution, I decided to undertake an interview with Daniel: the client for this project, and another regular user of Github. I wanted to focus on the interface that would be easiest to use, while also being the most accessible for the most people.</p>

<p>The transcript of the interview is given below, with no modifications save the elimination of pauses.</p>

<pre><code>Me: So, what's the most important thing you want to see in this project? Do you want something that looks pretty; something that 'just works'?

Dan: I think the most important thing is flexibility. It's alright if it works for me; I can deal with the command line syntax or whatever. But it'd be great if there was some kind of menu as well, rather than having to type everything out.

Me: I understand, so should there be more than one possible interface?

Dan: Yeah, I guess that could work. I mean, sometimes you're just going to want to run a single command and have it run in the background, and sometimes you're gonna want to inspect each one, maybe look at its description, before you decide whether you want to clone it or not.

Me: I'm thinking about using the Curses framework to design menus for this project, you know, with buttons labelled clone, skip and so on. Can you see any problems with that?

Dan: Well, I don't know, I haven't had great results with Curses on Windows, so that might be worth considering.

Me: Yeah, I think there's a few problems with terminal control, the command prompt is pretty outdated - so should there just be a text-based version as well, that doesn't need terminal control like that?

Dan: That could work, yeah. Just on the subject of being easy to use, would this project show the original Git errors if any get thrown? Sometimes I'd like to see those, or at least see what type of error it was.

Me: Yeah, that could be integrated for sure - the original errors should get logged in a standard form, and there'll be a slightly nicer error message on screen for the non-experts. So, we've got two interfaces, and both of them need some way of checking which repositories the user actually wants -- unless they just want to download everything?

Dan: Can we do that? I mean, I don't just want to go through every repository clicking "Yes, yes, yes"-

Me: Sure, I'll add an option just to download everything. Anything else you'd like to see?

Dan: Nah, sounds good to me. I'll be using this a lot though, so there'd better not be any bugs!

Me: I'll do my best.
